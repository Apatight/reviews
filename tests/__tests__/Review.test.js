The staff were so nice and thoughtful, the suite was large and spacious, an extremely comfortable bed and a dink g area big enough it have the family around for a meals to celebrate together. The staff are very attentive and the hotel feels very secure. \n\nThe Redwood Room was great to gather friends and have drinks, stylish and has a great vibe. \n\nOverall we canâ€™t recommend this place enough!",
